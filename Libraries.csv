It has been essential to close the building to allow us to investigate the problems and appoint a contractor to carry out the repair work. 
While the library is closed we're working hard to serve our community in alternative locations. We've got the library mobile parked on Falcon Road West where you can borrow and return books, and keep in touch with our staff team. Its opening hours are Monday 10am-7pm, Tuesday to Saturday 10am-4pm.
Our monthly bookgroups on Monday nights and Thursday afternoons are running from Newington Library, along with our fortnightly sewing group on Monday evenings which is still open for new members.
Our much needed library link and housebound service are also running from Newington Library, meaning that Morningside Library members with mobility issues can continue to access our services or have books, dvds and cds delivered to their homes.
Our staff team is gearing up for summer by visiting schools in the area to promote our reading challenge, and will soon be advertising summer activities in local church halls to ensure local children don't miss out.
Our Bookbug Sessions are currently being held in the Eric Liddell Centre at 10.30am every Tuesday morning.
Whilst the building is closed we are taking the opportunity to plan an even better library when we reopen. Your ideas and suggestions for any improvements we could deliver in time for the reopening are welcome, as well as any suggestions for service delivery while we're closed, so please get in touch at southteam@edinburgh.gov.uk and we can add your details to our mailing list.
