#Open Data

The City of Edinburgh Council gathers many types of data to help deliver and inform our work, and we want to make this available where possible to add value for work in communities, organisations and businesses. We hope that our data sharing may encourage innovation in the city, developing new approaches to delivering services and developing new systems to support the quality of life in Edinburgh.

We will be adding more data sets in the future and welcome suggestions from you if there is data you would like to see. It may not always be possible to share this right away, but we will do our best to make it available. Please contact opendata@edinburgh.gov.uk

By all means please do help us improve it where it's needed; see the [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines for information on how to contribute.
