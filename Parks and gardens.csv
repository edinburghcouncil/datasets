Blackford Pond and the surrounding wetland are important for water birds such as swan, little grebe, heron, pochard, mallard and tufted duck. Moorhen and coot nest at the edge of the pond amongst the reeds.
Scrub, grassland and cliff faces around Blackford Hill provide food and shelter all year round. Look for linnets, skylark and meadow pipit in the gorse bushes on the hill.

It's a large site with attractive woodlands, glades and grassland.","The house, policies and surrounding farmlands at Cammo were bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) in 1975 following the death of Percival Maitland-Tennent, the last occupier of Cammo House. In 1977 the house was partly destroyed by a two separate fires which left only the chimney stacks and outside walls standing.
The NTS feud the estate to the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) in 1979. At this time the house was considered to be in dangerous condition and was therefore partially demolished and by 1980 the only remaining walls are those can that still be seen today. The policies of the Estate were originally part of a larger estate which was a designed landscape initially by Sir John Clerk of Penicuik.","Wildlife interest in the site is in both its habitat and its fauna. The veteran trees and associated parkland habitat, the rich and diverse fauna (particularly badgers and
birds), the number of plant species of restricted distribution and the ecological history all contribute to the significant ecological value that has led to esignation as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation and recommendation for designation as a Local Nature Reserve. The Estate has considerable value as a local recreational and educational urban fringe
facility. The park is regarded as somewhat of a refuge by local users who value the ‘informal’ and ‘natural’ character of the site where they can spot wildlife and experience the changes in season.",,"Access is via the car park located on Cammo Walk on the southern edge, on the north-east side by North gate and by the Main gate on the east side.

It passed from the Prestons to Sir John Gilmour (a distant relative) in 1660 and remained with that family until 1946 when it passed to the state and then onto Historic Scotland who manage it today.","The area is a mixture of open parkland with groups of veteran trees; mature woodland located around the fringes of Craigmillar Hill; and recently created woodland established on the fields on the north and western edges of the Hill. The young woodlands at the north of the park are made up of many different native species: alder, birch, oak, ash and hawthorn are just some. These trees are excellent places to see and hear the many small birds that live in the park, such as bullfinch. Watch for the buzzards soaring over the grasslands in the park. They make a mewling cry as they call to each other.

A short walk around the Nature Trail - devised and maintained by a group of local residents - reveals a surprising variety of habitats. The park has been awarded a Green Flag since 2009, in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","The name Craiglockhart probably comes from either the Lockhart family, who owned the land in the 14th century, or is from the gaelic description of the area- Craig-Loch-ard (rocky hill by a loch).
In 1773 the estate was sold to the Munro family. Alex Munro planted trees on Easter Craiglockhart and allowed residents to walk there. In 1917, the war poets, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Own were treated at the Craiglockhart Hydropath, built in 1880 (now Edinburgh Napier University Craiglockhart Campus). ","Beside the Craiglockhart Sports Centre lies a large ornamental pond, dating from 1878, which drains into a carefully managed marsh - an unusual habitat in a city.  This marsh is home to orchids, provides a hunting ground for herons and is a safe haven for smaller waterfowl to raise their broods. The slopes of the hill are clad in semi-natural woodland, that is, woodland planted at least 200 years ago which is so well-established that it has been colonised by plants, birds and animals of ancient woodland.  A large meadow at the top of the Hill is another rare habitat for a city - unimproved grassland, home to small mammals and wild flowers.","Old red sandstone formed 400 million years ago under a shallow sea, then 325 million years ago, volcanoes erupted. When they cooled they formed the hard igneous rock which is Easter Craiglockhart Hill. You can see this rock as lava outcrops. The softer, green coloured rock on the edge of the hill is volcanic tuff, which is volcanic ash expelled when the volcano erupted.  Later, earthquakes caused the rock to split leaving steep sided cliffs. 12,000 years ago a huge sheet of ice covered the area. When it melted, the valleys were cut leaving the hills you see today.","Reached by Lothian Bus numbers 24,27 or 29.",,,"<a href=""http://eventsedinburgh.org.uk/Parks-Greenspace.html"">Find out how to organise an event in Edinburgh's parks</a>","<a href=""http://www.craiglockhartwoods.org"">Craiglockhart Woods website</a>","<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/78/countryside_management_and_conservation/710/natural_heritage_sites"">Natural Heritage Ranger Service</a>","Since 2009","<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/7053/easter_craiglockhart_management_plan_draft"">Easter Craiglockhart Management Plan</a>","Look at the levels of woodland- each level is home to insects, birds and mammals.","55.923431638952884,-3.233156204223633"

Other attractions include the Ice House, the Doocot within the walled garden and a pump system along the burn which was used to provide running water to the House. The reserve holds a Green Flag in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","The area is steeped in history - some of which is told in the old Hermitage House where the Headquarter of the City of Edinburgh Countryside Natural Heritage Ranger Service provides a charming Visitor Centre full of displays, activities and information. You can also explore the surroundings to discover the Ice House, the Doocot in the Walled Garden and even a clever water pump system along the burn that provided running water to the Hermitage House in the past!
The first recorded owner of this area was the son of a Belgian knight called De Brad, in the 12th Century. His son, Henri De Brad, was Sheriff of Edinburgh. He and his guests hunted for deer and wild boar in the forest.
In 1775 the architect Robert Burn was employed by Charles Gordon of Cluny to design the mansion house. The house was finished in 1788 and it was around this time that the dovecot, walled garden, stables and ice house were built. The dovecot housed pigeons which were eaten by the householders. The ice house was used to store food. It was kept cold by filling the base with ice colleted from local ponds and wrapped in straw, so it melted more slowly.
In 1937, the Hermitage was presented to the city as a public park by the owner John McDougal.","There is a wonderful mixture of habitats including woodland, scrubland, grassland, the Braid Burn and wetland which all provide a refuge for wildlife.  Listen for green woodpecker calling from the top of the tall beech trees and if you are lucky, you could startle a fox hunting rabbits or even an otter swimming in the burn! Don't forget your binoculars as you might be surprised by the amazing birdlife you will encounter; herons, kestrels, kingfishers, song thrush and even tawny owls can be regularly seen around the Nature Reserve! A visit to Blackford Pond will give you a chance to get close to swans, mallards, geese, coots and more depending on the time of year. The Hermitage of Braid is a designated ancient woodland. This means that woodland has covered the site for at least 300 years. However, much of the woodland is now semi-natural with beech (Fagus sylvatica), Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Sycamore (Acer pseudplatanus) regenerating freely. Most of the large, mature tees probably date from the early 19th century and there are many very old and large specimens scattered throughout the attractive woodland setting. Many exceed 40m in height, especially those growing in the valley bottom, which could make them the tallest trees in Edinburgh.","Blackford Hill is a contrast to the deep gorge of the Hermitage Wood. The Hill was formed from the oldest rock in Edinburgh and offers impressive panoramic views of the city, the Pentland Hills and Firth of Forth. Enthusiastic geologists love this place as it is full of significant hotspots to study rock formation. In 1840 the Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz declared the grooves in the rocks of Blackford Quarry were caused by glaciers and this was the start of a whole new chapter of geological study in Scotland .",,"Public toilets are located at the stables.

Site of orignial Botanic Gardens","Hidden off Leith Walk this peaceful garden provides a place of quiet refuge for local residents and a place to play for local school children. Its claim to fame is it is the site of the original Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh. The park has been awarded a Green Flag since 2008, in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","In 1763 a Physic Garden, with a large plant collection, was established off Leith Walk by John Hope. The 5 acre site was designed to reflect the new discoveries and knowledge of Botany at that time. By 1820, when Robert Graham became the 3rd Regius Keeper, the Garden site established by John Hope could no longer accommodate its collections properly, so the decision was made to move it to a new site in Inverleith where the current Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh is now found.  
The old site was built on as Edinburgh expanded and the small area of garden left became a neglected site - full of rubbish. In the 1990s the local community started to get involved with the site and in 2002 the Friends of Hopetoun Crescent Garden were established. They breathed fresh life into the park by clearing the rubbish, upgrading paths and installing interpretation panels.","The Garden was always planned as a natural wildlife park and to this end many thousands of wild flowers, wild grasses and spring bulbs have been planted by local children and the Friends group.

The park holds a Green Flag in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","The park was once meadow land belonging to the Earl of Moray, who used the loch for irrigation. The area required much work before it could be turned into a public park, with drainage and levelling the top priorities at the time. There are two old buildings at the northern end of the park which attract interest. One is called the Doocot and was probably used for keeping pigeons, but is also associated with stories from local residents that infected clothes were burned there during epidemics. The other building is a pump station, which was used to pump water to supply the Leith area.","There are a range of habitats to be found in the park. The loch is home to a wide variety of wildfowl, including swans, geese, coots and mallards. A viewing platform and planting beds, funded by the City of Edinburgh Council and WREN, were created around the pond in the spring of 2011. The viewing platform gives people greater access to see the wildlife and allows local schools the chance to take part in pond dipping activities. The new planting, including yellow flag iris and water mint, will enhance the biodiversity of the pond by providing more habitats and food for the local wildlife.  
Hermitage Park Primary School have worked with the Park Rangers to plant a variety of plants in the south of the park to create a bee cafe.",,,,,"<a href=""http://eventsedinburgh.org.uk/Parks-Greenspace.html"">Find out how to organise an event in Edinburgh's parks</a>","<a href=""http://en-gb.facebook.com/pages/Friends-of-Lochend-Park/109797945756275"">Friends of Lochend Park Facebook page</a>","<a href=""http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/download/1506/parks_and_greenspace_podcasts"">Lochend Park podcast</a>","Since 2012",,,"55.961500968488146,-3.1604576110839843"

Sculpted by glaciers and water, then shaped by people over thousands of years, the Pentland Hills are a special place for everyone. With around 10,000 hectares of countryside and over 100 km of waymarked paths, the Regional Park is a great place for walking, cycling, horse riding, fishing and orienteering. The Regional Park offers both gentle and challenging routes, taking you to summits, through cleughs and glens as well as around reservoirs. Vistas from the higher tops give a panoramic view across the Firth of Forth, the Borders and to Ben Lomond. The Park has two visitor centres, Harlaw House Visitor Centre and Flotterstone Information Centre that provide information, advice and displays on what to do and see in the Regional Park. Located adjacent to Harlaw House Visitor Centre is Harlaw Wildlife Garden, a lovely sun trap ideal for picnics. It holds a Green Flag in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","The Pentland Hills Regional Park was designated in 1986. Majority of the land is in private ownership, with the City of Edinburgh Council, Midlothian Council and West Lothian Council all having statutory duties to their constituent parts of the Park. The City of Edinburgh Council is the leading authority of the Regional Park, with the City of Edinburgh Council Natural Heritage Service providing the Park services.
The Regional Park has four aims that the three local authorities agreed to adhere to: 1.To retain the essential character of the hills as a place for the peaceful enjoyment of the countryside; 2. Caring for the hills so that the landscape and the habitat is protected and enhanced; 3. Within this caring framework to encourage responsible public enjoyment of the hills; 4. co-ordination of these aims so that they co-exist with farming and other land uses within the Pentland Hills Regional Park.
The Park is rich with heritage; from archaeological sites including 12 scheduled ancient monuments, such as, hill forts and cairns, to geological sites that are 430 million years old including three Geodiversity sites. The Pentlands are also steeped in history, with the Battle of Rullion green taking place in 1666 as well as being the hunting ground for Sir Robert the Bruce.","The Park contains a variety of important habitats: heather moorland, woodland, open grassland and reservoirs. This rich mosaic of wildlife, open spaces, farmed land and natural beauty is a result of people having been part of the landscape for thousands of years. Working closely with farmers, landowners and communities, the Pentland Hills Regional Park seeks to retain the essential character of the hills. For bird watchers the Park is abundant with both resident and migrating species. The Park has three enclosed bird hides where hours can be spent watching the wildfowl. The Natural Heritage Service offers the opportunity for the public to help survey some of the rarer species in the Regional Park.

The park has been awarded a Green Flag since 2010, in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","In the early 1900s the site was originally a bandstand. The area was later converted to a small semi-enclosed public park, with an open air paddling pool. However, as with so many great Victorian parks and public spaces, it was neglected over time and was in a semi derelict state when the local community came together to save it in 2006. The Portobello Amenity Society obtained a Heritage Lottery Grant to repair and erect three ""Coade Stone"" Pillars within the garden and carry out landscaping of the area to create the community garden you see today. 
The Coade Stone Pillars date from the early 19th century. They are listed structures which used to stand in the garden of Argyle House, Hope Lane. The pillars were restored by Graciela Ainsworth and her team of stone conservators. New crown tops for two of the pillars were skilfully made by local potter Alison Robinson.

The majority of the area came into Council ownership in 1900 when it was purchased from Sir William Baird Tuke. At that time a nine-hole golf course, nursery and playing fields were laid out. The area enclosed by the old garden wall was designed to include a rose garden. In 1908 Saughton became the site of the great Scottish National Exhibition, opened by HRH Prince Arthur of Connaught . During the Second World War the formal gardens were turned into onion beds as Saughton helped dig for victory. The Saughtonhall mansion house, which had earlier been turned into an asylum for the mentally ill, was destroyed in a controlled burning by the fire bigrade has it had become riddled with dry rot.

On route it passes through the towns of Balerno, Currie and Juniper Green before reaching Colinton and Craiglockhart Dell.  The Dell is a wooded gorge which is a haven for wildlife; and the woodland dates back as far as 1750.  Downstream from the Dells the river passes the Water of Leith Conservation Trust Visitor Centre before flowing through Gorgie, Saughton Park, Roseburn – passed Murrayfield Stadium, Dean Village and Stockbridge before reaching Leith.  The Walkway is a popular route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders alike; it is used for recreation as well as commuting.","The river once powered up to 90 water mills providing paper, snuff, linen and flour– the remains of these can be seen in the weirs and buildings along the length of the river.  Now, the river and surrounding woodlands are home to a great variety of wildlife.
You may discover many old buildings along the Water of Leith, including two 18th Century grottos and Redhall Doocot.  Between Dean Village and Stockbridge you will see two mineral wells, one of which is St Georges Well, built in 1810.  St Bernard’s Well was discovered in 1760 and the Roman Temple was built in 1789, it became popular for the believed healing power of its mineral water.","Kingfishers nest along the banks of the river and can often be seen patrolling their territory.  Increasingly there is otter activity along the length of the river.

More than 80 species of birds, including a variety of finches, tits, dippers, wrens, herons and owls can be seen along the river.  On land; voles, frogs, rabbits, hares, weasels, stoats and foxes can be found.  You may also see roe deer in the Dells.",,"Water of Leith Conservation Trust
